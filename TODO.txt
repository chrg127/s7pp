- cmake
- documentation

partially completed, not sure if actually completed:
- more checks when defining ops on usertypes

probably won't do soon:
- (possibly) more error stuff
- hook stuff seems cool but is a feature not attached to anything else?
- signature for overloads
- multidimensional vectors
- bignums
